AURORA borealis,</em> or northern
lights, begin high in the Earth’s
atmosphere—at altitudes from
60 to more than 250 miles—
when charged particles from the
sun become trapped in the
Earth's magnetic field. The result
is a colorful, dancing light show</p>

  <p><em>THE NORTHERN LIGHTS</em>, also called Aurora Borealis, and Norðurljós in Icelandic,
     are one of the most spectacular shows on this earth and can frequently be seen
     in Iceland from September through March on clear and crisp nights. The Northern
      Lights occur high above the surface of the earth where the atmosphere has become
      extremely thin, at an altitude of 100-250 km. They are created by electrically
      charged particles that make the thin air shine, not unlike a fluorescent light.
      Auroras can be seen in auroral belts that form 20-25 degrees around the geomagnetic poles,
      both the north and the south. </p>
<p>The name Northern Lights was first chronicled in the original Old Norse, as
  “norðrljós”, in 1230; while the name Aurora Borealis (“Dawn of the North”) is
   jointly credited to have first been used by Galileo Galilei and Petrus Gassendus
   in the 17th century. Derived from Aurora, the Roman goddess of Dawn, and Boreas,
   the Greek god of the North Wind, the name evokes some of the majestic, otherworldly splendour of an auroral display.
</p>
The phenomenon is easily explained by modern science. What our ancestors may have
thought when they gazed into the brightly-lit winter sky is quite another matter.
At all events, don't let any scientific explanation spoil your appreciation of the
beauty of the Northern Lights. They are a truly impressive spectacle, whatever their cause.
