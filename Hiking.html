  <p>This is where the second part of the hike starts: the Fimmvorduhals Trail.
    You’ll climb up a steep mountain to gain a thrilling view over the green valley
    and the jagged, mossy ridges. You’ll have the opportunity to wander in between three
    glaciers and visit the notorious Eyjafjallajökull eruption site that was freshly
    formed in 2010. The hike ends at what’s probably Iceland's most famous waterfall,
     the majestic Skógafoss.</p>
<p>The Laugavegur & Fimmvorduhals Trek can be completed in 6–8 days depending on
  how much time you’d like to spend in Thorsmork and Landmannalaugar. Along the way,
  you can sleep in mountain huts or pitch a tent at the campsite next to the building.
  The paths are accessible from late June to early September every year. Out of season,
  the huts are closed as the area is not safe to hike in.
</p>
If you’re looking to explore the vastness and diversity of Icelandic nature, this
is your trek! Let’s go on this adventure together! Join us on the grand Laugavegur
& Fimmvörðuháls Trek adventure!
